# Universal AI Teaching Agent  
**Intelligent • Multimodal • Personalized Learning System**

The **Universal AI Teaching Agent** is an adaptive AI-powered tutoring platform designed to deliver **personalized, multimodal, and accessible education** to learners of all backgrounds. The system integrates **Large Language Models (LLMs), Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), Text-to-Speech (TTS), Interactive Visualizations, and Continuous Learning Pipelines** to transform static digital learning into dynamic, intelligent tutoring.

## 🚀 Project Overview

Traditional e-learning platforms provide static, one-directional content that does not adapt to a learner’s pace, preferences, or performance. This project introduces a **hybrid AI architecture** that continuously learns from user interactions and delivers:

- Personalized explanations  
- Adaptive assessments  
- Multilingual voice output  
- Interactive visualizations  
- Offline/low-resource support  

The platform functions as an **AI teacher**, not just a content delivery tool.

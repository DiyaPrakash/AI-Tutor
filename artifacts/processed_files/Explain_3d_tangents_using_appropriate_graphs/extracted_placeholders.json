An arrow representing the tangent vector r'(pi) originates from P and points along the curve's direction. A straight line representing the tangent line passes through P and extends in the direction of the tangent vector."

At a specific point P on the paraboloid, a flat plane representing the tangent plane is shown touching the surface only at P. An arrow representing the normal vector to the surface at P is shown originating from P and perpendicular to the tangent plane."

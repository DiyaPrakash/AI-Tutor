# Introduction to 3D Calculus

Calculus, at its core, is the study of change. Single-variable calculus (often called 2D calculus) deals with functions of one independent variable, focusing on slopes and areas. 3D calculus, also known as multivariable or vector calculus, extends these concepts to functions with multiple independent variables.

In 3D calculus, we move from the plane to 3D space, enabling us to model complex phenomena:
*   Temperature distribution in a room.
*   Fluid flow, represented by vector fields.
*   Gravitational force, varying with position.
*   Volumes of solids and surface areas of curved objects.
3D calculus provides the tools to understand and quantify change in multiple dimensions.

# Core Concepts of 3D Calculus

## Functions of Multiple Variables
We consider functions with multiple inputs and one output.
*   A function with two inputs and one output. Its graph is a surface in 3D space.
*   A function with three inputs and one output. Its graph exists in 4D space, visualized using level surfaces.

## Partial Derivatives
Partial derivatives describe how a function changes with respect to one variable while holding others constant:
*   The rate of change of the function with respect to one input, treating other inputs as constant.
*   The rate of change of the function with respect to another input, treating other inputs as constant.
These represent slopes of the surface in specific directions.

## Gradients
The gradient of a scalar function is a vector pointing in the direction of the greatest rate of increase of the function. The magnitude of the gradient gives the maximum rate of increase.

## Double and Triple Integrals
Double and triple integrals extend the concept of definite integrals to higher dimensions:
*   **Double Integrals**: Calculate volumes under surfaces, areas in a 2D plane, or quantities over a 2D region.
*   **Triple Integrals**: Calculate volumes of 3D solids, mass, or average value over a 3D region.

## Vector Fields
A vector field assigns a vector to each point in space. They model forces, fluid flow, and wind patterns.

## Line Integrals and Surface Integrals
*   **Line Integrals**: Integrate along a curve. Applications include work done by a force.
*   **Surface Integrals**: Integrate over a surface. Applications include calculating flux.

## Fundamental Theorems of Vector Calculus
These theorems relate integrals and derivatives:
*   **Green's Theorem**: Relates a line integral around a closed curve to a double integral over the enclosed region.
*   **Stokes' Theorem**: Relates a line integral around a closed curve to a surface integral over a surface bounded by the curve.
*   **Divergence Theorem (Gauss's Theorem)**: Relates a surface integral over a closed surface to a triple integral over the enclosed solid.

# Trigonometry: The Study of Triangles

Trigonometry is a branch of mathematics that studies the relationships between the **angles and sides of triangles**.

Its primary focus is on **right-angled triangles**, using specific ratios—**sine (sin), cosine (cos), and tangent (tan)**—to define how an angle relates to the lengths of its opposite, adjacent, and hypotenuse sides.

These fundamental ratios enable us to calculate unknown angles or side lengths. Beyond triangles, trigonometry is essential for understanding periodic phenomena, waves, and rotations, with broad applications in physics, engineering, and navigation.
